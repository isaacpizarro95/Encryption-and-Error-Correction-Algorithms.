Being in too much of a hurry can hurt. Don't ignore a crash when it happens; track it down right away, since it may not happen again until it's too late. A famous example occurred on the Mars Pathfinder mission. After the flawless landing in July 1997 the spacecraft's computers tended to reset once a day or so, and the engineers were baffled. Once they tracked down the problem, they realized that they had seen that problem before. During pre-launch tests the resets had occurred, but had been ignored because the engineers were working on unrelated problems. So they were forced to deal with the problem later when the machine was tens of millions of miles away and much harder to fix. Another effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you." This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human.
